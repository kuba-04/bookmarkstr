# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Nostr Bookmarks Viewer

## 1. Product overview

This product is a desktop browser extension designed for viewing Nostr bookmarks. It leverages React for the user interface and integrates relay and error handling logic from nostr-provider.js. The extension allows users to securely log in using their private key, fetches active relays immediately, and then loads all bookmarks in chronological order. Bookmarks with URL content are rendered as clickable links that open in a new browser tab. The overall design is minimal and intuitive, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## 2. User problem

Users often find it challenging to access their Nostr bookmarks efficiently on desktop devices. Mobile-based Nostr clients do not provide an optimal experience for quick viewing and navigation of bookmarks. The problem is further accentuated by the need for secure access using private keys, as well as the requirement for a clear, responsive interface that can handle potential issues during data fetching robustly. Users need a dedicated solution that is both secure and easy to use, enabling them to instantly view and interact with their bookmarks.

## 3. Functional requirements

1. Authentication: Allow users to securely log in using their private key without storing it persistently.
2. Relay Fetching: Automatically fetch all active relays immediately after successful login.
3. Bookmark Loading: Retrieve and display user bookmarks in chronological order after relays are fetched.
4. Clickable Links: Render bookmarks containing URLs as clickable elements that open in a new browser tab.
5. Error Handling: Provide clear and user-friendly error messages for any failures during relay or bookmark fetching.
6. One-Time Data Load: Ensure bookmarks are loaded only once per session after login.
7. Loading Indicator: Display a loading state while data (relays and bookmarks) is being fetched.
8. Security: Handle private key authentication securely, ensuring that sensitive information is never stored or exposed.

## 4. Product boundaries

1. Scope: The extension is solely focused on viewing Nostr bookmarks and does not include features for bookmark creation, editing, or deletion.
2. Platform: Designed as a desktop browser extension, even though it builds on mobile-based Nostr components.
3. Data Handling: The MVP does not support encrypted bookmarks or advanced security measures beyond basic private key authentication.
4. User Interface: The design will mimic the nostr-connect repository, utilizing existing React components and Tailwind CSS for a consistent look and feel.

Acceptance criteria:

- A persistent loading indicator is displayed during data fetching on slow networks.
- Timeouts or extended load times trigger a message advising the user of potential network issues.
- The system can recover from slow network conditions without crashing.

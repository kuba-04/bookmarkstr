1. The MVP will be a desktop browser extension for viewing Nostr bookmarks, even though the underlying Nostr client is mobile-based.
2. The focus for the MVP is solely on viewing bookmarks and not on editing, creating, or handling encrypted bookmarks.
3. The approach will largely mimic the nostr-connect repository, using components such as the React-based UI (e.g., popup.tsx) and the relay and error handling logic from nostr-provider.js.
4. Upon user login via their private key, the extension should immediately fetch the userâ€™s relays and then load all bookmarks in chronological order.
5. Bookmarks containing links must be clickable and open the corresponding URL in the browser.
6. Basic error handling, inspired by the patterns in nostr-connect, will be implemented for failures in relay or bookmark fetching.
7. The design should be minimal, intuitive, and leverage existing frameworks (React and Tailwind CSS) from the reference project.
8. The bookmarks will be loaded only once (one-time load) upon successful login.

<matched_recommendations>.

1. Use the UI structure from the nostr-connect repository (e.g., popup.tsx) as a blueprint for the bookmark-viewing screen.
2. Leverage the relay fetching and error handling logic from nostr-provider.js to integrate relay retrieval and bookmark loading.
3. Simplify the MVP by omitting features such as encrypted bookmark handling.
4. Implement immediate data fetching upon private key entry, including loading indicators similar to those in the reference.
5. Adopt a minimal yet intuitive UI design that clearly displays clickable bookmarks in chronological order.
6. Ensure basic error handling is in place to manage issues during relay or bookmark fetching.
7. Use a one-time data load approach for bookmarks.

<prd_planning_summary>.
The project aims to develop a desktop browser extension that allows users to view their Nostr bookmarks as specified by NIP-51. The extension will enable users to log in using their private key, trigger an immediate fetch of all active relays, and subsequently load the user's bookmarks in chronological order. Key functional requirements include displaying the bookmarks in a clear list format, where any bookmark containing a URL is rendered as a clickable link that opens in a new browser tab. The development approach will mirror the nostr-connect repository by using React for the UI and reusing existing logic from nostr-provider.js for operations like relay fetching and basic error handling. User stories include scenarios where users log in securely and instantly view their stored bookmarks in an intuitive layout. Success will be measured by the responsiveness of the extension, ease of navigation, and accurate, chronological display of bookmarks with correct link behaviors.

<unresolved_issues>.

1. Clarification may be needed on the specifics of the API endpoints or data sources from which bookmarks will be fetched.
2. Detailed security measures around private key handling remain high-level and could require further refinement in future iterations.
